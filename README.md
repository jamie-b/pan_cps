# pan_cps

pan_cps pulls the number of new connections per second as well as the total number of connections on a Palo Alto Firewall.
It then logs that information to a CSV file to allow for analysis or visualization of the data.  This is really useful
information if you are trying to configure zone protection profiles and need connection information to use as a baseline.
